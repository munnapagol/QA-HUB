                    <p>I am trying to find the relevant parts of Standard that explain how the above two simplifications
                        work. I've looked at [basic.lookup] and grepped for trailing-return, but couldn't find anything
                        straightforward that explained how the above transformations work.

                        Have I missed it? Here</p>
